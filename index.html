            <h2 class="section-title">The Full Story</h2>
            <p>In the busy halls of Mapua Malayan Colleges Laguna, among thousands of passing faces, two souls were destined to collide. They spent a whole year as strangers in Grade 11, never speaking a word. But 2024 brought a shift. Through PE dances and stage plays, the Assistant Director found his Queen. What started as a "husband and wife" role in a dance became a reality that neither could have predicted. Through nervous letters, Roblox games, and midnight confessions, Adriel and Micah turned a chance encounter into a beautiful, enduring love story.</p>

            <div class="letter-text">
                <p>Thirteen months might seem like just a number to some, but to me, it’s 395 days that I haven’t had to walk through this world alone...</p>
                <p>I love looking back at where we started. It’s funny how we spent all of Grade 11 at MMCL as total strangers, never saying a single word. I had no idea then that the girl I didn’t talk to would eventually become my whole world...</p>
                <p>Working on that stage play together, with me as your Assistant Director and you as my Queen, was when everything shifted. I’ll never forget November 13, 2024, the day we started chatting on IG...</p>
                <p>Thank you for choosing me every single day for the last thirteen months. I am so deeply in love with who you are and who we are becoming together. Happy 13th Monthsary, my beautiful Macchi. Here is to a lifetime more.</p>
                <p class="signature">Forever yours, <br>Adi</p>
