            <h2 class="section-title">The Full Story</h2>
            <p>In the busy halls of Mapua Malayan Colleges Laguna, among thousands of passing faces, two souls were destined to collide. They spent a whole year as strangers in Grade 11, never speaking a word. But 2024 brought a shift. Through PE dances and stage plays, the Assistant Director found his Queen. What started as a "husband and wife" role in a dance became a reality that neither could have predicted. Through nervous letters, Roblox games, and midnight confessions, Adriel and Micah turned a chance encounter into a beautiful, enduring love story.</p>

        <div class="parchment">
            <h2 class="chapter-title">My Dearest Macchi,</h2>
            <div class="letter-text">
                <p>Thirteen months might seem like just a number to some, but to me, it’s 395 days that I haven’t had to walk through this world alone. Every morning I wake up, the first thing I feel is gratitude—gratitude that in a world of billions of people, I somehow found you.</p>
                <p>I love looking back at where we started. It’s funny how we spent all of Grade 11 at MMCL as total strangers, never saying a single word. I had no idea then that the girl I didn’t talk to would eventually become my whole world. Then came Grade 12, and fate really took over. From that first small interaction about our PE dance song to the "accident" of us being cast as husband and wife for that performance—it’s like the universe was already practicing for our future.</p>
                <p>Working on that stage play together, with me as your Assistant Director and you as my Queen, was when everything shifted. I’ll never forget November 13, 2024, the day we started chatting on IG and couldn't stop teasing each other. I didn’t know it then, but while I was falling for you, you were already "looking" for me, waiting for me to join those Roblox games just so we could be near each other.</p>
                <p>I still laugh thinking about how nervous I was to give you that first letter—so nervous I had to make my friend do it for me! Making you guess who it was might have been a bit "evil," but hearing you say you liked me back was the best moment of my life. From our first cheek kiss before Christmas break to that long, long hug on January 6th at the KTV, every step felt like coming home.</p>
                <p>I asked to court you on the night of the 13th, but I love that we couldn't even wait 24 hours. Becoming your boyfriend at midnight on January 15 was the start of the greatest journey I’ve ever been on. From our first date at "But First Coffee" outside Birmingham to the way we held onto each other when things got hard, you have shown me what real love looks like.</p>
                <p>Even when things felt impossible after Tita found out and the "barricades" went up, we didn’t break. We only got stronger. Seeing how far we’ve come—to the point where I’m now accepted, even if just as a "friend" for now—makes me so incredibly happy. It’s a step closer to us, and I’ll take every step, no matter how small, as long as it's with you.</p>
                <p>Thank you for choosing me every single day for the last thirteen months. I am so deeply in love with who you are and who we are becoming together. Happy 13th Monthsary, my beautiful Macchi. Here is to a lifetime more.</p>
                <p class="signature">Forever yours, <br>Adi</p>
